	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. An efficient algorithm has low time complexity, meaning it can handle large inputs quickly.</p>
    <p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires as a function of the length of the input. It measures how much memory an algorithm uses as the input size increases. Algorithms with O(n) space complexity use a linear amount of memory relative to the input size.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity is represented as <b>O(n)</b> in Big O notation.</p>
