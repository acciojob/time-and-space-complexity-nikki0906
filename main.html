	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution as a function of the size of the input data. Efficient algorithms are those with low time complexity, meaning they can handle large inputs without taking too much time to execute.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to solve a computational problem as a function of the size of the input data. It is often denoted by <b>O(n)</b>, where <em>n</em> represents the size of the input. Space Complexity can become a concern when dealing with large datasets, as inefficient use of memory can lead to performance issues.</p>
