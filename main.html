    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>In computer science, time complexity is a measure of the amount of time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution. It is a crucial aspect to consider when analyzing the efficiency of algorithms. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, meaning they can perform their tasks quickly.</p>

    <p>Space complexity is another important metric in algorithm analysis. It measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. Space complexity is typically expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to how the memory usage scales with the input size.</p>
