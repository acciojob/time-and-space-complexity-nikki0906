    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, meaning they can solve problems quickly and are suitable for large datasets.</p>

    <p>Space complexity is the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It indicates how the memory usage of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. Space complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> describes the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of its memory usage.</p>
